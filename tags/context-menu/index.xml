      <description>Awesome (work)week in Toronto without the lights, sights, Blue Jays, CN Tower or Timmies.
Toronto Workweek Until last week I had only heard of the term &amp;ldquo;workweek&amp;rdquo; mentioned on multiple occasions in my short time at Mozilla. Last week from very early Monday (4:30 am) to late Friday (11:45 pm) I had my work week in Toronto. Workweeks are an opportunity to do some work on a project, collaborate with fellow Mozillians, checkout the local office if there is one but also to an extent enjoy the location where you are during that week.</description>
