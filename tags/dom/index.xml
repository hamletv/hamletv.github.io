      <description>Demo My script is running. Yes! Small victories regardless of project complexity are awesome. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing that makes one (at least me) feel more victorious than spending an inordinate amount of time on something that you feel shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have taken an inordinate amount of time and then finally overcoming the (temporary) hurdle. A won battle can momentarily feel like a conquered war. With the script now working and producing an actual result (and even a confidence percentage of the output printed), it was time to do a demo.</description>
